## Player API Limitations & Current Implementation

**Important Note:** Fotmob does not provide a public API endpoint for detailed player data. The current player functionality works with the following approach:

### Current Player Features
- **Basic Player Information**: Player name, ID, position, and current team
- **Player Photos**: Official player images from Fotmob's CDN
- **Team Integration**: Direct links to player's current team details
- **Favorites Management**: Full support for adding/removing player favorites
- **Browser Integration**: Direct links to complete player profiles on Fotmob website

### Data Source & Limitations
- **Search-Based Data**: Player information is gathered from search API results
- **Limited Statistics**: No access to detailed career stats, match history, or performance metrics
- **Basic Profile**: Shows essential information but directs users to Fotmob website for comprehensive data
- **Graceful Fallback**: Provides useful functionality while acknowledging data limitations

### Why This Approach?
After extensive testing, Fotmob's player detail endpoints are either:
- Not publicly accessible (return 404 errors)
- Require special authentication not available to third-party apps
- Reserved for their official mobile and web applications

### User Experience
The implementation prioritizes user experience by:
- **Transparent Communication**: Clearly explaining data limitations to users
- **Useful Actions**: Providing quick access to official Fotmob player pages
- **Seamless Integration**: Maintaining consistency with team and other features
- **Favorites Support**: Full player favorites functionality for organization

## Implementation Summary

This update adds comprehensive player functionality to the Fotmob extension:

### New Commands Added

### New Components Created

- **Fallback Strategy** - Graceful handling when detailed player APIs are unavailable
- **Error Handling** - Clear user guidance when player data cannot be found

**Note:** Direct player detail APIs are not publicly available, so the implementation uses search data and provides browser links for complete information.

All new functionality follows existing code patterns and maintains consistency with the current extension architecture.
